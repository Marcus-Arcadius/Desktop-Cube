# Changelog of the Desktop Cube Extension


## [Desktop Cube 4](https://github.com/schneegans/Desktop-Cube/releases/tag/v4)

**Release Date:** TBD

#### Enhancements

* The transition from desktop to overview does not fold / unfold the cube any more.
* Cube-face-position computations has been refactored. There are now constants in the code to reliably specify the gap between adjacent workspaces as well as to stretch the position of the next and previous workspace horizontally. This ensures that the side faces of a four-sided cube are visible from the front.
* This changelog has been added.

#### Bug Fixes
* Fixed overlapping workspaces if there are many workspaces.
