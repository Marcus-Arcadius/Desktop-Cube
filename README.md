When I started using Linux more than a decade ago, it was because of the 3D desktop cube of Compiz.
Even if this was a pretty useless feature, I am still missing it today.
As we already have the awesome [Compiz-alike windows effects](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2950/compiz-alike-windows-effect/), I thought it was time to revive 3D workspaces as well!

For a list of things changed in previous releases, you can have a look at the [changelog](docs/changelog.md)!

## üíû These People _love_ this Extension

While coding new features is the most awesome way to contribute, providing financial support will help me stay motivated to invest my spare time to keep the project alive in the future.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

You can either install the Desktop Cube extension from extensions.gnome.org (a), download a stable release
from GitHub (b) or clone the latest version directly with `git` (c).

### a) Installing from extensions.gnome.org

This is the easiest way to install the Desktop Cube extension. Just head over to
[extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4648/desktop-cube) and flip the switch!
If you want to use a more up-to-date version, you can try one of the methods listed below.

### b) Downloading a Stable Release

Execute this command to download the latest stable release:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Schneegans/Desktop-Cube/releases/latest/download/desktop-cube@schneegans.github.com.zip
```

Install it by executing the following command. If you have the Desktop Cube extension already installed and want to upgrade to
the latest version, append the `--force` flag in order to overwrite existing installs of the Desktop Cube extension.

```bash
gnome-extensions install desktop-cube@schneegans.github.com.zip
```

Then restart GNOME Shell with <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd>, <kbd>r</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
Or logout / login if you are on Wayland.
Then you can enable the extension with the *Gnome Tweak Tool*, the *Extensions* application or with this command:

```bash
gnome-extensions enable desktop-cube@schneegans.github.com
```

### c) Cloning the Latest Version with `git`

You should **not** clone the Desktop Cube extension directly to the `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` directory as this may get overridden occasionally!
Execute the clone command below where you want to have the source code of the extension.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Schneegans/Desktop-Cube.git
cd Desktop-Cube
```

Now you will have to install the extension.
The `make` command below compiles the locales, schemas and resources, creates a zip file of the extension and finally installs it with the `gnome-extensions` tool.

```bash
make install
```

Then restart GNOME Shell with <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd>, <kbd>r</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
Or logout / login if you are on Wayland.
Then you can enable the extension with the *Gnome Tweak Tool*, the *Extensions* application or with this command:

```bash
gnome-extensions enable desktop-cube@schneegans.github.com
```

## :octocat: I want to contribute!

That's great!
Here are some basic rulles to get you started:
Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in present tense (e.g. __:tada: Add cool new feature__ instead of __:tada: Added cool new feature__).
You should also start your commit message with **one** applicable emoji.
This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit. Make many but small commits!
